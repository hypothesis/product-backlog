# product-backlog
Purpose: All new features, bugs, customer requests will be curated in this repo. We will use the issues created here to flesh out features, designs, and requirements. 

*What happens here, doesn't stay here*
- The issues reported in this repo will be worked on in other Hypothesis repos. 
- Issues created in #product-backlog will serve as parent cards that track all information about that request. 
- All Google docs, PR info, or issues created in other repos must be linked back to issues created in this repo. 
- We're implementing this system so that we can have complete transparency around our product developement process.
